## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check existing reports as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

### Making Pull Requests

Keep the commit log as healthy as the code. It is one of the first places new contributors will look at the project.

1. No more than one change per commit. There should be no changes in a commit which are unrelated to its message.
2. Follow [these conventions](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) when writing the commit message.

When filing a Pull Request, make sure it is rebased on top of most recent master.
If you need to modify it or amend it in some way, you should always appropriately 
[fixup](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) the issues in git and force-push your changes to your fork.
